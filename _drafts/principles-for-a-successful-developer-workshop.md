<img class="img-right" src="{{ page.image }}"/>Running a successful developer workshop (aka tutorial) is really difficult. I've attended enough workshops that have gone poorly to know that for a fact. Participating in such a workshop can be very frustrating and a huge turn off for whatever technology is being presented. That translates directly into losing developer mindshare. I think we, as an industry, can do a better job of running developer workshops.

I've run workshops at Gluecon, QCon, SXSW, and internally at Rackspace. They've gone well enough that I've come up with a set of principles that I follow in an attempt to give developers a better experience. I'll layout the general principles and the tools/techniques I typically use to implement them.

## Principles for a Successful Developer Workshop

1. Know Your Audience
1. Share Your Content First
1. Start From A Clean Environment
1. Walk-Through Sign Ups
1. Be Explicit
1. Make It Accessible
1. Get Feedback
1. Get Help
1. Do Less
1. Empathy

## Know Your Audience

Attempt to understand your audience. Demographics. Stickies.

## Share Your Content First

share materials at the beginning. write it down. encourage people to file issues during the workshop. given that your audience will have a wide variety of skill levels, provide the materials beforehand.

## Start From A Clean Environment

start with a clean env. Don't do the massive download thing.

## Walk-Through Sign Ups

walk-through sign ups. probably doesn't deserve to be a principle.

## Be Explicit

be explicit. don't use short params on the CLI. diagrams. don't say, "as you probably already know" or any version of those words ever.

## Make It Accessible

make it readable. know your zoom settings, move text to the top, hide your toolbars, remove distractions.

## Get Help

get help. have TAs.

## Get Feedback

get feedback. practice, watch out for taking shortcuts. empathy.

## Do Less

do less. pause. break. labs.

## Coda

Empathy
