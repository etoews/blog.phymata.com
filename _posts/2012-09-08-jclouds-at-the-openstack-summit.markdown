I'm attending the [OpenStack Summit](https://www.openstack.org/summit/san-diego-2012) from Oct. 15-18 in San Diego. I've submitted a session titled Control the Clouds: Developer Experience with jclouds.Â Sessions are voted in so, if you're inclined, please vote for my session. [You'll need to do a Find in Page for "jclouds" on the voting page](https://www.openstack.org/summit/san-diego-2012/vote-for-speakers/). The deadline for voting is Sept. 13 and here's a description of the session.

In this session, you will learn how to write code that can control any cloud with jclouds.

Developers tend towards cross-platform solutions. Many popular languages and toolkits can run on many operating systems and devices. HTML and the web browser are the prime example of this trend. The benefits are clear, it gives developers the most bang for their buck when it comes to learning new skills and reaching the widest audience.

The cloud has emerged as the next major platform. So where do developers turn for cross-cloud toolkits?

For Java, the answer is jclouds. jclouds is an open source cross-cloud toolkit that works with both public and private clouds, enabling hybrid cloud workloads. The list of supported clouds includes AWS, Azure, vCloud, HP Cloud, OpenStack, and the Rackspace Open Cloud. There is a great community behind this toolkit working together to provide a better experience for developers in the cloud. Their goal is to simplify the control of many different clouds while still giving you the freedom to use cloud-specific features. The result is a toolkit that allows developers to write better code, in a shorter period of time, that works with any cloud.

In this session, I will demonstrate these qualities of jclouds. If you're so inclined, you'll be able to follow along with the demostration and write your own code that works with any cloud (hotel wifi permitting ;)

Prerequisites if you choose to follow along:
* JDK 1.6
* Cloud accounts such as:
[trystack.org](http://trystack.org)
[hpcloud.com](http://hpcloud.com)
[rackspace.com/cloud/public/](http://rackspace.com/cloud/public/)

If you're going to be at the Summit as well and you'd like to meet up, just let me know in the comments!
