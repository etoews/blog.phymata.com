I've updated my [totalbottomtime.com](http://totalbottomtime.com/) website (total bottom time is the amount of time a diver has spent at depth). The vision for it is to be an online dive community where scuba divers from around the world can log their dives and share them with family, friends and other divers. For now I'm the only member of the "community" and so it's serving as my personal dive log. I plan to continue adding features to it and eventually hope to open it for registration to the public.

In the meantime I thought it would be good to get a few eyeballs on it if you'd like to have a look. You can find a list of the dives I've recorded so far at totalbottomtime.com/blog/everett/. My latest are from a trip to Australia. If you notice anything that doesn't work (e.g. a link doesn't take you to the right place) or if a web page looks weird in your browser please send me an email and let me know.

If you're interested in following my dive log you can subscribe to it via email or RSS. To do so click on one of my dives from the site. On the right hand side you'll notice a profile box that looks like the one below.

<div class="img-center"><img src="/img/posts/profile.jpg"/></div>

To subscribe via email click on the mail icon that I've circled in red on the left. You'll be taken to another web page where you fill in your email and a verification question. You'll then get an email to where you need to click on a link to confirm your subscription. After that you'll receive an email every time I add to my dive log.

If you know what RSS is and you're comfortable subscribing to feeds then click the orange icon on the right.
