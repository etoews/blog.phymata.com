I was at Gluecon 2013 a few weeks ago and caught a great session from Jeff Lindsay & Solomon Hykes about [Docker](http://www.docker.io/). Docker is an open-source engine which automates the deployment of applications as highly portable, self-sufficient containers which are independent of hardware, language, framework, packaging system and hosting provider.

The coolest part of the talk was when Jeff gave a demo of a mini-Platform as a Service he created the previous night dubbed [Dokku](https://github.com/progrium/dokku) that was built on Docker and running on the Rackspace Cloud. Check it out in the video below. The demo starts at 21:00.
