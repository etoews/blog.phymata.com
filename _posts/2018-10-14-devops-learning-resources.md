<img class="img-right" src="{{ page.image }}"/>A curated list of learning resources I've used to evolve my own understanding of the principles and practices of DevOps.

## Articles

* [What is DevOps](https://www.atlassian.com/devops)
  * I'm actually quite partial to the CALMS framework for DevOps.
* [Products Over Projects](https://martinfowler.com/articles/products-over-projects.html)
  * How things are funded has a fundamental impact on how work proceeds.
* [DevOps Enterprise Summit Forum Papers](https://itrevolution.com/forum-papers/)
  * A wealth of easily consumable knowledge and advice on all things DevOps.

## Blogs

I use [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) to subscribe to blogs. I hope RSS/Atom never dies.

* [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/)
* [Container Solutions](https://container-solutions.com/blog/)
  * They write more about cloud native but it's all DevOps as far as I'm concerned.

## Books

The first three books here are absolutely required reading.

* [Accelerate](https://itrevolution.com/book/accelerate/)
* [The Phoenix Project](https://itrevolution.com/book/the-phoenix-project/)
* [The DevOps Handbook](https://itrevolution.com/book/the-devops-handbook/)
  * If someone says "DevOps has no definition", hit them over the head with this book.
* [The Unicorn Project](https://itrevolution.com/the-unicorn-project/)
* [Site Reliability Engineering](https://landing.google.com/sre/books/)

## Events

* [devopsdays](https://devopsdays.org/)
  * A global phenomenon of DevOps practitioners getting together to learn from each other. I can't recommend these highly enough.
* [DevOps Enterprise Summit](https://events.itrevolution.com/)

## Courses

* [The DevOps Foundation video courses on LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/devops-foundations)
  * I know the instructors and they’re long-time practitioners of DevOps
* There are also training and accreditation organisations. Opinion on their validity varies. I’ve never done any of these so cannot vouch for them but I do know some trainers.
  * [DevOps Institute](https://devopsinstitute.com/)
  * [ICAgile DevOps](https://www.icagile.com/Learning-Roadmap/DevOps)
  * [DevOps Agile Skills Association](https://www.devopsagileskills.org/)

## Distributed teams

* [GitLab's Remote Manifesto](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/04/08/the-remote-manifesto/)
* [GitLab's Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/)
  * The [Communication section](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication) has some good tips on dealing with the signal-to-noise ratio in Slack.

## Podcasts

* [DevOps Cafe](http://devopscafe.org/)
* [Arrested DevOps](https://www.arresteddevops.com/)

## Tools

### Containers

* [The Docker Book](https://dockerbook.com/)
  * Kept updated and the updates are always free. Amazing value.
* [Kubernetes The Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way)
  * Working through this tutorial is a must if you're at all serious about deploying Kubernetes.

### Git

* [Comparing Git Workflows](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows)
  * I’m a big proponent of the feature branch workflow, potentially with forks.
  * The Gitflow workflow can be necessary for more complex projects/products
