<img class="img-right" src="/img/posts/newsupermariobros-star.png"/>It's that time of year again to vote for sessions at the OpenStack Summit in Hong Kong. First of all I encourage you to vote for any and all of the sessions using the newÂ [OpenStack Presentation Voting](http://www.openstack.org/rate) web app. It's a great app and it drops you into the action right away by presenting you with a random session to vote on. The ability to use keyboard shortcuts to vote is really handy too. I've got a couple of sessions proposed to the Summit focused on the application developers building solutions on top of OpenStack.

**The OpenStack Community Welcomes Developers in All Languages**

The OpenStack application programming interface (API) is accessible via web services. However, the application developers who are buildling solutions on top of OpenStack do not want to talk to that API directly. They want to talk to OpenStack in the programming language of their choice. That means using software development kits (SDK) written in a variety of programming languages. These SDKs allow the developers to be more efficient and productive when using OpenStack.

**Java on OpenStack**

Java is a popular programming language across the entire world. The documentation for Java has been translated into both Chinese and Japanese over the years. It plays a pivotal role in enterprise, open source, and mobile software development.

If you want to build a Java application on OpenStack, you need a toolkit. A very popular toolkit for cloud application development is jclouds.

jclouds is an open source library that helps you get started in the cloud and utilizes your Java development skills. The jclouds toolkit gives you the freedom to use portable abstractions or OpenStack specific features. It works with both public and private clouds, enabling hybrid cloud workloads. There is a great community behind this toolkit working together to provide a better experience for developers in the cloud.

## SXSWi

<img class="img-right" src="/img/posts/panelpicker_vote_14-blog.jpg"/>While we're on the subject of voting, I've also proposed a session to South by Southwest Interactive (SXSWi). The focus of the session is on cloud and I'm hoping to garner enough votes to present there in 2014.

**Cloud Portability With Multi-Cloud Toolkits**

It's a multi-cloud world but your code needs to run somewhere. However, the Infrastructure as a Service cloud you choose today may not be the cloud you need tomorrow. Changes in reliability, performance, cost, and privacy may drive you to research alternative public clouds, a private cloud, or a hybrid of the two.
Considering cloud portability upfront can be crucial in avoiding lock-in. The tools you use to interact with the cloud will play a large part in how portable your code is between clouds.

In this session you'll learn how to effectively use software development toolkits that operate across multiple clouds. Find out how to distinguish between the layers of abstraction to achieve maximum portability or utilize cloud specific features. I'll show examples of multi-cloud toolkit code for Java (jclouds), Node.js (pkgcloud), Python (libcloud), and Ruby (fog).
