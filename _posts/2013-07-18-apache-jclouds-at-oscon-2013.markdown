Apache jclouds will be getting a lot of recognition at OSCON 2013 this year.

**jclouds: Control Multi-Cloud Infrastructure With Java**

On Monday, July 22 at 7:00 pm in room D137/138 I'll be hosting a jclouds birds of a feather (BoF) session. In this BoF I’ll introduce you to Apache jclouds and what it can do for you.

jclouds is an open source library that helps you get started in the cloud and utilizes your Java or Clojure development skills. The jclouds API gives you the freedom to use portable abstractions or cloud-specific features. It’s a multi-cloud toolkit that works with both public and private clouds, enabling hybrid cloud workloads.

There is a great community behind this toolkit working together to provide a better experience for developers in the cloud. Their goal is to simplify the control of many different clouds while still giving you the freedom to use cloud-specific features. The result is a toolkit that allows developers to write better code, in a shorter period of time, that works with the many supported clouds.

Once the introduction is finished, we can discuss any topics from novice to expert. I’m a committer on jclouds and will do my best to answer any questions you might have!

**Cloud Portability With Multi-Cloud Toolkits**

On Wednesday, July 24 at 11:30 am in room E143 I'll be presenting about multi-cloud toolkits in general, including comparing jclouds with multi-cloud toolkits from other languages such as node.js, Python, and Ruby.

It’s a multi-cloud world but your code needs to run somewhere. However, the cloud you choose today may not be the cloud you need tomorrow. Changes in reliability, performance, cost, and privacy may drive you to research alternative public clouds, a private cloud, or a hybrid of the two.

Considering cloud portability upfront can be crucial in avoiding lock-in. The tools you use to interact with the cloud will play a large part in how portable your code is between clouds.

In this session you’ll learn how to effectively use software development toolkits that operate across multiple clouds. Find out how to distinguish between the layers of abstraction to achieve maximum portability or utilize cloud specific features. I’ll show examples of multi-cloud toolkit code for Java (jclouds), Node.js (pkgcloud), Python (libcloud), and Ruby (fog).
